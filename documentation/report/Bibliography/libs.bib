abstract = {We present a technique to model wave-based sound propagation to complement visual animation in fully dynamic scenes. We employ 2D wave simulation that captures geometry-based diffraction effects such as obstruction, reverberation, and directivity of perceptually-salient initial sound at the source and listener. We show real-time performance on a single CPU core on modestly-sized scenes that are nevertheless topologically complex. Our key ideas are to exploit reciprocity and use a perceptual encoding and rendering framework. These allow the use of low-frequency finite-difference simulations on static scene snapshots. Our results show plausible audio variation that remains robust to motion and geometry changes. We suggest that wave solvers can be a practical approach to real-time dynamic acoustics. We share the complete C++ code of our "Planeverb" system [source repo].},

  abstract = {Since the proposal of a fast learning algorithm for deep belief networks in 2006, the deep learning techniques have drawn ever-increasing research interests because of their inherent capability of overcoming the drawback of traditional algorithms dependent on hand-designed features. Deep learning approaches have also been found to be suitable for big data analysis with successful applications to computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In this paper, we discuss some widely-used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted. A list of future research topics are finally given with clear justifications.}

We approach the sound source distance estimation task as an image classification problem, and we aim to classify a given audio signal into one of three predefined distance classes—one meter, two meters, and three meters—irrespective of its orientation angle. For the purpose of training, we create a dataset by recording audio signals at the three different distances and three angles in different rooms. The CRNN is trained using time-frequency representations of the audio signals. Specifically, we transform the audio signals into log-scaled mel spectrograms, allowing the convolutional layers to extract the appropriate features required for the classification. When trained and tested with combined datasets from all rooms, the proposed model exhibits high classification accuracies; however, training and testing the model in separate rooms results in lower accuracies, indicating that further study is required to improve the method’s generalization ability. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to estimate sound source distances in known environments by classification using the log-scaled mel spectrogram.},

As part of the challenge, a synthesized dataset where each sound event associated with a spatial coordinate represented using azimuth and elevation angles is provided. These sound events are spatialized using real-life impulse responses collected at multiple spatial coordinates in five different rooms with varying dimensions and material properties. A baseline SELD method employing a convolutional recurrent neural network is used to generate benchmark scores for this reverberant dataset. The benchmark scores are obtained using the recommended cross-validation setup.},

A significantly more complex dataset is created for DCASE 2020 compared to the previous challenge. The two key differences are a more diverse range of acoustical conditions, and dynamic conditions, i.e. moving sources. The spatial sound scene recordings for all conditions are generated using real room impulse responses, while ambient noise recorded on location is added to the spatialized sound events. Additionally, an improved version of the SELD baseline used in the previous challenge is included, providing benchmark scores for the task.",
